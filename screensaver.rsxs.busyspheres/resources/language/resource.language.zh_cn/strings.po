# [Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/

# [Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!
# [Description / location] For example, "#. Description of some setting" used on "#: xbmc/addons/guidialogaddoninfo.cpp"
# When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
